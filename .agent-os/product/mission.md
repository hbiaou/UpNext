# UpNext Mission

## Product Pitch

UpNext is a privacy-first, AI-powered task and note manager that runs entirely as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on the user's device with no backend or hosting requirements. It solves the problem of task management fragmentation by combining natural language AI interaction with traditional task management, allowing users to create, organize, and complete tasks through conversation while maintaining complete data ownership and offline functionality.

## Target Users

### Privacy-Conscious Professionals
Knowledge workers who want AI assistance without sending data to cloud services, using it for daily task management aligned with their short and long-term goals, with personalized onboarding that creates relevant starter tasks based on their work description and objectives.

### Productivity Enthusiasts
Users familiar with tools like Todoist/Notion who want a faster, local-first alternative with AI capabilities, leveraging conversational onboarding to set up their workspace, define goals, and maintain focus through AI-guided daily planning based on their stated priorities.

### Solo Entrepreneurs & Freelancers
Individual business owners needing powerful task management without subscription costs, using the profile system to track business goals, client projects, and personal development, with AI providing context-aware suggestions based on their work description and current focus areas.

## Problems We Solve

### Data Privacy Concerns
Traditional task managers require cloud storage and data sharing, creating privacy risks for sensitive work and personal information.

### Task Management Fragmentation
Users struggle with switching between different tools, leading to scattered tasks and reduced productivity.

### Subscription Fatigue
Most productivity tools require recurring payments, creating financial burden for individual users and freelancers.

### Complex Setup and Onboarding
Existing tools often require extensive configuration before becoming useful, creating barriers to adoption.

### Limited Offline Functionality
Cloud-based tools fail when internet connectivity is poor or unavailable.

## Key Differentiators

### Complete Privacy Control
All data stays on the user's device with optional export/import for backups - no cloud storage required.

### AI-Powered Without Compromise
Users provide their own API keys for AI features, ensuring no data sharing while maintaining powerful AI capabilities.

### Zero Cost Operation
Free hosting via GitHub Pages, no subscription fees, with optional user-provided AI API costs only.

### Conversational Interface
Natural language task creation and management through AI chat, making task entry faster and more intuitive.

### Offline-First Architecture
Full functionality available offline except for cloud AI features, with local data persistence.

## Core Features

### Conversational AI Task Management
Create, categorize, prioritize, and complete tasks via natural language chat using the user's own API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or compatible services), with smart date parsing, automatic categorization, task breakdown suggestions, daily briefings, and motivational insights. Exploring browser-based AI models as a free fallback option.

### Two-Panel Adaptive Interface
Split-screen layout with AI chat on the left and task manager on the right featuring Today/Upcoming/Completed tabs, with responsive single-panel view on mobile, drag-and-drop task reordering, categories and labels system, and celebration animations on task completion.

### User Profiles & Smart Onboarding
Personalized profiles storing name, work description, short-term focus, long-term goals, and task sorting preferences. Interactive conversational onboarding that creates initial tasks based on user's goals, or quick setup via settings button, with onboarding tasks serving as starter tasks.

### Offline-First PWA with Local Storage
All data stored locally using browser storage with persistent data across sessions, one-click PWA installation from browser, JSON export/import for backup and device transfer, and full offline functionality except for cloud AI features.

### Smart Task Features
Subtasks within tasks, priority levels (High/Medium/Low) with auto-prioritization, natural language due dates, context-aware categories and labels, customizable sorting preferences, and AI-generated daily summaries based on user's goals and focus areas.

### Data Backup & Security
Regular backup encouragement with clear Export Data button saving all user data (tasks, profiles, settings) as JSON or Markdown files. Simple Import Data functionality to restore from backups. User education about data volatility with transparent warnings about browser data clearing risks.
